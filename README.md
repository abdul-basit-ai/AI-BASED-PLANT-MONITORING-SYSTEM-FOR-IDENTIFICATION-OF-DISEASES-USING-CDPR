# AI-BASED-PLANT-MONITORING-SYSTEM-FOR-IDENTIFICATION-OF-DISEASES-USING-CDPR
This repository related to the final year project of my bachelors studies. In which me along with 2 team member under the supervision of Dr Abdul Attayyab Khan completed the design of an AI based Robotic system that is able to detect the disease of different plants using the capabilities of CNN's. In this project we implemented five differnet type of CNN's Architecture and then used their weights for running the inference on Raspberry Pi attached at the end effector equipped with camera for real time detection that we monitored on Raspberrry Pi's server.

ABSTRACT
The agriculture sector of Pakistan has been the largest source of employment for
laborers and the greatest contributor to the GDP through the foreign exchange of
crops over the years. Pakistan is an agro-based economy, but the sector's contribution
has declined to 18.5% for numerous reasons. One of the principal issues is poor crop
yield, which is associated with the late identification of plant diseases. To identify
symptoms of diseased leaves manually is time-consuming and inefficient.
Researchers have found a solution through inducing deep learning and machine
learning in image processing. This detailed report introduces an innovative AI-based
Plant Monitoring System designed to rapidly and accurately identify. In its early
stages, manually placing the symptoms is time-consuming, depending entirely on
farmers' visual power, making it labor-intensive. The system integrates advanced
machine learning algorithms with high-resolution imaging to analyze plant health by
enabling early detection of diseases. This report presents a comparative analysis of
different Convolutional Neural Network architectures encompassing ResNet50,
VGG16, VGG-19, MobileNet, and MobileNetV2 trained and validated on 18 classes
of tomatoes, apples, potatoes and grapes. After this, their accuracy, precision, recall,
f1-score, size, and inference time are compared to find the optimal algorithm.
